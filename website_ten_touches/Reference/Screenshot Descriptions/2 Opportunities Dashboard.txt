## Opportunities Dashboard (Pipeline You Can *Feel*)

### What this screen is

This is **not** a spreadsheet pipeline.
It’s a **priority-aware, relationship-linked opportunity list** designed for quick decision-making on mobile.

You’re not analysing deals here — you’re *orienting yourself*.

---

## Features (What’s on the screen)

### 1. Open Opportunities List

* Clean, card-based layout
* Each opportunity presented as a self-contained unit
* No tables, no columns, no density overload

### 2. Sort Controls

* Sort by *Client, Touch, Value, Product*
* Directional toggle (ascending / descending)
* Designed for fast mental grouping rather than admin sorting

### 3. Opportunity Card Structure

Each card includes:

* Opportunity name (product / service)
* Client name
* Total deal value
* Visual progress indicator (touch circular score)
* Clear tap affordance

### 4. Progress / Confidence Indicator

* Circular touch progress ring
* Numeric score (e.g. 4/10, 8/10)
* Colour-coded outlines per opportunity

This is **confidence**, not just stage.

### 5. Immediate Value Visibility

* Deal values are prominent
* No need to open the record to know importance
* £0 opportunities still visible (signal, not noise)

---

## Benefits (Why this matters)

### 1. Instant Pipeline Awareness

**Benefit:**
In under 10 seconds, you know:

* What’s live
* What’s big
* What’s close
* What’s weak

No filtering. No reports. No thinking.

---

### 2. Mobile-First, Real-Life Use

**Benefit:**
This works:

* In a lift
* Between meetings
* Before walking into a call
* At the end of the day

Traditional CRMs assume a desk.
Ten Touches assumes *reality*.

---

### 3. Confidence Over False Precision

**Benefit:**
Instead of fake accuracy (“Stage 2, 37% probability”), you get:

* A human confidence score
* Visual momentum
* Relative certainty

That’s how salespeople actually think.

---

### 4. Emotionally Honest Pipeline

**Benefit:**
Seeing:

* £75k at 1/10
* £8k at 4/10
* £777k at 8/10

…prevents self-delusion.

It encourages better focus and better follow-up behaviour.

---

### 5. Opportunity Cards Feel Lightweight

**Benefit:**
You don’t feel like:

> “Ugh, I have to open a deal record”

You feel like:

> “Let me just tap into this for a second”

That’s a *huge* adoption win.

---

## User Journey (How it feels to use)

### Step 1: Opening the Dashboard

You open Ten Touches.

You’re not greeted with:

* Alerts
* Overdue warnings
* Red shame indicators

Instead, you see **what’s alive**.

---

### Step 2: Rapid Mental Sorting

Without touching anything, your brain instantly sorts:

* “That’s a big deal but early”
* “That one’s nearly there”
* “That’s basically dead”
* “Why is this still £0?”

No clicks required.

---

### Step 3: Confidence Calibration

You subconsciously adjust expectations:

* Today’s focus
* This week’s priorities
* Which conversations matter most

This happens *before* you consciously decide anything.

---

### Step 4: Tap With Intent

When you tap an opportunity, it’s intentional:

* You already know the value
* You already know the confidence
* You already know the client

So the next screen (opportunity detail) feels like **progress**, not exploration.

---

### Step 5: Reduced Friction vs Traditional CRMs

**Traditional CRM pain:**

* Pipeline views designed for forecasting calls
* Endless columns
* Desktop-only logic
* Over-precision that nobody believes

**Ten Touches experience:**

* Human confidence
* Visual momentum
* Honest uncertainty
* Designed for movement, not reporting

---

## Key Insight for Documentation & Sales Messaging

This screen proves:

> *Ten Touches helps you see your pipeline the way it actually feels — not the way spreadsheets pretend it is.*

That’s a powerful positioning angle, especially against legacy CRMs.
