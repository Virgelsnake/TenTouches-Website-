## Client Detail Screen (Relationship-Centric Client Card)

### What this screen is

This is the **heart of Ten Touches**. It’s not a “contact record” — it’s a *relationship memory surface*. Everything here is designed to help the user recognise, recall, and strengthen a real human relationship in seconds.

---

## Features (What’s on the screen)

### 1. Clear Client Identity Header

* Full name prominently displayed
* Immediate access to edit
* Back navigation optimised for mobile use

### 2. Business Information Block

* Company
* Position / role
* Email
* Phone number
* Clean, scannable layout
* Tap-to-use contact details (implicit mobile-first design)

### 3. Client Quality Scoring (4-Star System)

Four distinct star ratings:

* Testimonials
* Referrals
* Feedback
* Repeat business

Each:

* Individually scored
* Visually obvious
* Quantified (number inside star)

### 4. Personal Information Section

Highly human, non-CRM data:

* Sports played and followed
* Teams supported
* Pets (type, name, breed)

This data is:

* Structured
* Searchable
* Contextual (icons + labels)

### 5. Information Hierarchy

* Business info first (credibility)
* Personal info second (relationship)
* No clutter, no fields-for-the-sake-of-fields

---

## Benefits (Why this matters)

### 1. Instant Recognition in the Real World

**Benefit:**
When you bump into someone unexpectedly, you don’t need perfect recall.

You can search later by:

* Their dog’s name
* Their football team
* Their role
* Their company

This mirrors *how humans actually remember people*.

---

### 2. Stronger, Warmer Conversations

**Benefit:**
You walk into conversations informed:

* “How’s Charlie the Beagle?”
* “How did United do at the weekend?”
* “How’s business at GreenForge going?”

This builds trust faster than any sales technique.

---

### 3. Built-in Behavioural Nudges

**Benefit:**
The star system doesn’t shame — it *guides*.

You instantly see:

* “I’ve had repeat business but no testimonials”
* “This client refers people, but I’ve never asked formally”
* “Great relationship, but no structured feedback yet”

It quietly prompts better selling behaviour without a task list.

---

### 4. CRM That Feels Personal, Not Corporate

**Benefit:**
This doesn’t feel like data entry for management.
It feels like **your private relationship assistant**.

That’s why people will actually use it.

---

## User Journey (How it feels to use)

### Step 1: Opening the Client

You tap on *Daniel O’Connor*.

Immediately:

* You know who he is
* Where he works
* What he cares about
* How valuable the relationship currently is

No scrolling. No hunting.

---

### Step 2: Mental Reorientation

In under **5 seconds**, your brain reconnects:

* “Director at GreenForge”
* “Cricket fan, Ireland”
* “Supports Man United”
* “Two dogs — Charlie and Buddy”

This replaces the awkward *“Remind me again…”* moment.

---

### Step 3: Relationship Assessment (Subconscious)

Without thinking, you register:

* Strong repeat business
* Good referrals
* Feedback could be improved
* Testimonials could be increased

No report. No dashboard. Just *knowing*.

---

### Step 4: Action Motivation (Without Pressure)

Nothing screams “TASK”.

But you naturally think:

* “Next time I speak to him, I should ask for a testimonial”
* “He’d be a great referral source”

That’s behavioural design done right.

---

### Step 5: Reduced Friction vs Traditional CRMs

**Traditional CRM pain:**

* Endless empty fields
* Forced categorisation
* Zero emotional payoff

**Ten Touches experience:**

* Human-first
* Memory-aligned
* Immediately useful
* Feels like it’s *for you*, not the business

## Key Insight for Documentation & Sales Copy

This screen proves:

> *Ten Touches doesn’t store contacts.
> It preserves relationships.*

That sentence alone belongs in your product overview.
