## Opportunity Detail – Cashflow Risked by Progress Stage

### What this screen is

This is where **reality replaces optimism**.

Instead of pretending every deal is worth its headline number, Ten Touches forces a *constructive honesty* about revenue — without turning sales into accountancy.

It’s a **single-opportunity truth surface**.

---

## Features (What’s on the screen)

### 1. Clear Opportunity Context

* Product / service name (e.g. *Cybersecurity Audit*)
* Back navigation that keeps you in flow
* No clutter, no tabs

---

### 2. Headline Financials

* Total deal value prominently displayed
* Risked revenue shown alongside it
* Immediate contrast between *potential* and *probable*

Example:

* Total value: £18,000
* Risked revenue: £4,500

---

### 3. Confidence / Progress Bar

* Visual confidence indicator
* Clearly labelled percentage (e.g. 25% confidence)
* Intuitive colour progression

This is not a forecast — it’s a *signal*.

---

### 4. Four-Stage Progress Model

Simple, universally understood stages:

* Prospect (25%)
* Proposal (50%)
* PO (75%)
* Paid (100%)

Each stage:

* Visually represented
* Progressively weighted
* Easy to explain to anyone

---

### 5. Status Selector

* Live
* Lost
* Won (Implicitly won via Paid stage)

Clear separation between:

* Progress stage
* Outcome status

This avoids CRM ambiguity.

---

### 6. Notes Section

* Free-text, human-readable
* Captures real objections and next steps
* No forced formatting

---

### 7. Voice Input (At the Point of Truth)

* Record button directly on the opportunity
* Designed for immediate reflection
* No post-meeting admin loop

---

## Benefits (Why this matters)

### 1. Honest Revenue Visibility

**Benefit:**
You *cannot lie to yourself* on this screen.

Seeing:

* £18k potential
* £4.5k probable

…immediately changes behaviour.

---

### 2. Simple Mental Model = High Adoption

**Benefit:**
No:

* Probability percentages to argue about
* Complex stages
* Sales methodology jargon

Anyone can understand:

> “We’re at proposal, so it’s worth half.”

---

### 3. Separates Progress From Outcome

**Benefit:**
A deal can be:

* Advanced but lost
* Early but promising

This reflects reality far better than binary CRM logic.

---

### 4. Reduces End-of-Month Panic

**Benefit:**
Because risked revenue is always visible:

* Forecasting is calmer
* Expectations are grounded
* Surprises are reduced

This helps both sellers *and* leaders.

---

### 5. Voice Input Removes Reflection Friction

**Benefit:**
The moment after a call is when insight is freshest.

Being able to say:

> “Client has concerns about approach, send case studies and ISO cert”

…without typing ensures:

* Better data
* Better follow-up
* Better memory

---

## User Journey (How it feels to use)

### Step 1: Opening the Opportunity

You tap into *Cybersecurity Audit*.

Instantly, you’re grounded:

* What it is
* How much it’s worth
* Where it truly stands

No digging required.

---

### Step 2: Reality Check

Your eyes go straight to:

* Risked revenue

You think:

> “Right — this is not an £18k deal yet.”

This reframes:

* Urgency
* Effort
* Next action

---

### Step 3: Progress Reflection

You glance at the stage bar:

* Prospect highlighted
* Proposal and beyond greyed out

You instinctively ask:

> “What would move this to proposal?”

That’s the right question.

---

### Step 4: Capture Insight Immediately

You tap **Record** and speak:

* Objections
* Hesitations
* Required proof

No laptop.
No remembering later.
No lost nuance.

---

### Step 5: Reduced Friction vs Traditional CRMs

**Traditional CRM pain:**

* Fake precision
* Complex forecasting logic
* Post-meeting admin
* Stale notes

**Ten Touches experience:**

* Honest confidence
* Simple progression
* Immediate capture
* Actionable clarity

---

## Key Insight for Documentation & Sales Messaging

This screen proves:

> *Ten Touches doesn’t inflate your pipeline — it tells you the truth early enough to do something about it.*

That’s a *huge* differentiator for founders, consultants, and sales leaders alike.
