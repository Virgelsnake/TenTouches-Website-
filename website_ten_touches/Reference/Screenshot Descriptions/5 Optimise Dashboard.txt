## Dashboard – From Tracking to Intelligent Selling

### What this screen really is

This dashboard is **not analytics** and it’s **not reporting**.

It’s a **behavioural intelligence layer** that turns everyday sales activity into:

* self-coaching
* better decision-making
* faster deal progression
* higher-quality revenue

Crucially, everything here is designed for the **individual seller**, not management oversight.

---

## Dashboard Sections (What’s on the screen)

This dashboard is made up of **five complementary insight modules**, each answering a different sales question.

---

## 1. Activity Target & Momentum Tracking

### “Am I showing up consistently?”

**Features**

* User-defined activity target (e.g. *3 touches per 14 days*)
* Toggle to enable or disable tracking
* Simple +/- controls to adjust targets
* Bar chart showing touches completed over time
* Clear “Below Target” indicator

**Benefits**

* Encourages consistency without pressure
* Focuses on activity rhythm, not raw volume
* Makes momentum visible at a glance

**Why it matters**
Sales success is rarely about spikes of effort — it’s about cadence. This module reinforces habit-building without turning activity into a quota.

---

## 2. Pick Winners

### “Which actions actually work for me?”

**Features**

* Touch types displayed as icons (call, email, meeting, casual, etc.)
* Win rate per touch type
* Performance delta (+ / – points vs average)
* Sample size visibility (n=)

**Benefits**

* Shows which actions perform best *when used*
* Highlights underused high-performing touch types
* Removes guesswork from sales behaviour

**Why it matters**
Instead of generic advice like “make more calls”, the app tells you:

> “When *you* do this, it works.”

That insight is personal, credible, and motivating.

---

## 3. Match the Moment

### “What works best at different stages of a deal?”

**Features**

* Separate views for:

  * First touch
  * Last touch
* Win rate by touch type at each stage
* Clear visual contrast between strong openers and strong closers

**Benefits**

* Helps users start deals more effectively
* Helps users finish deals more decisively
* Reinforces the idea that *timing matters as much as action*

**Why it matters**
Most CRMs ignore *when* actions happen.
Ten Touches reveals that the same action can succeed or fail depending on the moment.

---

## 4. Sell Faster

### “Which actions close deals with fewer touches and less time?”

**Features**

* Average number of touches required to win per touch type
* Average days to win per touch type
* Side-by-side comparison across channels

**Benefits**

* Identifies the most efficient sales actions
* Helps reduce deal drag
* Supports smarter sequencing, not harder selling

**Why it matters**
This turns sales from endurance into efficiency.
Users learn how to win **with less effort**, not more.

---

## 5. Value Impact

### “Which actions show up in the revenue I actually win?”

**Features**

* Percentage contribution of each touch type to won revenue
* Sample size indicators
* Clear revenue correlation signals

**Benefits**

* Connects behaviour directly to outcomes
* Moves focus from activity to impact
* Reinforces high-value actions

**Why it matters**
This answers the most important question:

> “What’s actually making me money?”

---

## 6. Core Metrics & Outcomes

### “How am I doing overall?”

**Features**

* Conversion rate
* Average touches per deal
* Won vs lost comparison
* List of won and lost opportunities for reflection

**Benefits**

* Keeps high-level performance visible
* Encourages reflection without overwhelm
* Grounds insights in real outcomes

---

## User Journey (How this dashboard *feels* to use)

### Step 1: Casual Check-In

You open the dashboard without dread.

You’re not bracing for judgement — you’re curious.

---

### Step 2: Momentum Awareness

You glance at activity and instantly know:

* Am I consistent?
* Am I drifting?
* Am I back on track?

No spreadsheets. No guilt.

---

### Step 3: Pattern Recognition

Your eye moves naturally through:

* Pick Winners
* Match the Moment
* Sell Faster

You spot patterns without being told what to think.

---

### Step 4: Self-Directed Improvement

No tasks are created.
No rules are enforced.

You simply adjust behaviour:

* More of what works
* Less of what doesn’t
* Better timing

---

### Step 5: Reflection Without Regret

Looking at won and lost deals feels constructive, not punitive.

Losses become learning.
Wins become repeatable.

## How This Removes CRM Friction

**Traditional CRM dashboards**

* Built for managers
* Lagging indicators
* Overwhelming charts
* Little behavioural guidance

**Ten Touches dashboard**

* Built for the seller
* Leading indicators
* Clear, human insights
* Behaviour change without enforcement

---

## Key Positioning Insight (Very Important)

This screen proves:

> **Ten Touches doesn’t just tell you *what happened*.
> It shows you *how to get better next time*.**

That line belongs everywhere:

* Product overview
* Sales deck
* Website homepage
* Investor narrative
