## “Take Action Today” – Reminders Organised by Action Type

### What this screen is

This is **not** a task list.
It’s a **context-aware execution engine** designed around *how humans actually get tings done*.

This is Get Things Done (GTD) applied properly to sales.

---

## Features (What’s on the screen)

### 1. “Take Action Today” Header

* Strong behavioural framing
* Focused on *doing*, not managing
* Immediately answers: *“What should I do now?”*

---

### 2. Action-Type Filter Bar

Clearly defined, tappable contexts:

* All
* SMS
* Phone Call
* Email
* Meeting
* Linkedin
* Tweet
* Casual
* Event


This is **context filtering**, not priority sorting.

---

### 3. Action Cards (Reminder Items)

Each reminder includes:

* Action type (icon + label)
* Associated opportunity
* Client name
* Due date and time
* Free-text intent (“Check in after implementation”)
* Visual urgency cues (red for overdue)

---

### 4. Overdue Visibility Without Aggression

* Overdue items clearly marked
* No shame language
* No flashing warnings
* Still calm, still usable

---

### 5. Chronological Ordering

* Actions ordered by time
* Natural flow through the day
* No forced “importance” scoring

---

## Benefits (Why this matters)

### 1. Removes the “What Should I Do Now?” Tax

**Benefit:**
This screen eliminates decision fatigue.

You don’t:

* Re-plan your day
* Re-prioritise
* Re-think intent

You simply *execute*.

---

### 2. Works With Your Energy, Not Against It

**Benefit:**
You can match actions to mood and environment:

* Got 10 minutes? → SMS
* In the car? → Phone calls
* In a quiet space? → Emails

Traditional CRMs ignore human energy.
Ten Touches embraces it.

---

### 3. Sales Follow-Up Becomes Lightweight

**Benefit:**
Following up no longer feels like:

> “I need to sit down and do admin”

It feels like:

> “I’ll knock out a few calls now”

That shift massively increases consistency.

---

### 4. Zero Context Switching

**Benefit:**
Every reminder already contains:

* Who
* Why
* What
* When

You never have to:

* Open multiple records
* Search email threads
* Recall meeting context

---

### 5. Encourages Relationship Momentum

**Benefit:**
Because actions include *casual* and *non-selling* touches:

* Coffee
* Events
* Check-ins

The system reinforces relationship-building, not just deal chasing.

---

## User Journey (How it feels to use)

### Step 1: Opening Reminders

You tap **Reminders**.

You’re not hit with:

* A backlog
* A scary red list
* A feeling of failure

You’re invited to *take action*.

---

### Step 2: Context Selection

You ask yourself:

> “What do I feel like doing right now?”

You tap:

* **Phone Call**

Instantly:

* Everything else disappears
* Only relevant actions remain

No scrolling. No filtering gymnastics.

---

### Step 3: Micro-Execution Mode

You start working down the list:

* One call
* One SMS
* One quick check-in

Each action is small.
Each action is meaningful.
Each action moves a relationship forward.

---

### Step 4: Natural Flow State

You’re not “doing CRM”.

You’re just:

* Calling people
* Messaging contacts
* Maintaining momentum

The tool disappears. The work remains.

---

### Step 5: Reduced Friction vs Traditional CRMs

**Traditional CRM pain:**

* Tasks mixed with admin
* Artificial priorities
* Endless lists
* Follow-up avoidance

**Ten Touches experience:**

* Contextual clarity
* Low cognitive load
* Human pacing
* Action without resistance

---

## Key Insight for Documentation & Sales Messaging

This screen proves:

> *Ten Touches doesn’t tell you what’s urgent — it helps you do what you’re ready to do.*

That’s an incredibly strong positioning line for:

* Productivity-led buyers
* Founders
* Relationship sellers
