## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use a Battlecard
- When a competitor is named explicitly
- When prospect says "we already use X"
- When a deal shifts into comparison mode
- When pricing pressure emerges due to perceived parity

### When NOT to Use a Battlecard
- As a pitch deck or slide
- As a script to read verbatim
- In early discovery before problem alignment
- In product-led or self-serve flows

### How to Use Mid-Conversation
1. Scan for the relevant objection or scenario
2. Use the reframe language as a framework (adapt, don't read)
3. Ask the suggested follow-up question
4. Use the closing anchor to re-centre if conversation drifts

## Consistent Elements Across All Battlecards

### Anchor Statement (Universal)
> "Ten Touches helps relationship-driven salespeople remember everyone, follow up consistently, and sell smarter — without the admin burden that kills CRM adoption."

### Language to Lean Into
- Relationship memory
- Client (not contact/lead)
- Touch (any meaningful interaction)
- User value first
- Voice-first capture
- Self-coaching / behavioural insight

### Language to Avoid
- CRM clichés ("360-degree view", "single source of truth")
- Naming competitors directly (say "traditional CRMs" instead)
- Feature-for-feature comparisons
- Attacking competitors

## Alignment with Knowledge Base

All battlecard content aligns with:
- `1 Product Overview.txt` — Core positioning and philosophy
- `5 Value Proposition & Messaging.txt` — Message pillars and proof points
- `8 Objections_FAQ.txt` — Objection handling frameworks
- `11 Competitive Positioning.txt` — Differentiation pillars and category definitions

No battlecard introduces claims not already in the Knowledge Base.

## Quality Standards

A battlecard is complete only if:
- [x] A salesperson can use it mid-call without preparation
- [x] It does not require a slide or screen share
- [x] It avoids feature comparison tables
- [x] It helps change how the buyer thinks, not just what they compare
- [x] It's scannable in under 60 seconds

*Battlecards win conversations, not comparisons.*
