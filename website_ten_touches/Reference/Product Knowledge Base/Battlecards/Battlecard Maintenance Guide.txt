# Ten Touches Battlecard Maintenance Guide

**Created:** 22 January 2026  
**Owner:** Marketing  
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Review Cadence

### Quarterly Review (Every 3 Months)
- Review win/loss data for patterns related to specific competitors
- Update objection reframes based on sales feedback
- Verify all proof points still match current product capabilities
- Check if new competitor categories have emerged

### Triggered Review (As Needed)
- Major product update or new feature launch
- New competitor enters the market
- Significant change in competitive positioning
- Repeated feedback on battlecard gaps from sales

---

## 2. Feedback Loop from Sales

### How Sales Should Provide Feedback

**After competitive deals (win or lose):**
1. Which battlecard was relevant?
2. Which objection/reframe was used?
3. Did the reframe work? If not, what would have been better?
4. Any new objections heard that aren't covered?
5. Any new competitor named that doesn't have a battlecard?

**Feedback submission:**
- Slack channel: #sales-battlecard-feedback (or equivalent)
- Email: marketing@[company].com with subject "Battlecard Feedback"
- Sales meeting: Standing agenda item in weekly sales sync

### How Marketing Processes Feedback

1. Collect feedback in shared document/tracker
2. Identify patterns (same feedback from multiple reps = priority)
3. Draft updates
4. Review with sales lead before publishing
5. Announce updates to sales team

---

## 3. Versioning Approach

### Version Numbering
- Major version (1.0 → 2.0): Significant structural changes or new sections
- Minor version (1.0 → 1.1): Content updates, new objections, refined language

### Version History
Maintain a changelog at the bottom of each battlecard file:

```
---
## Version History

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 1.0 | 22 Jan 2026 | Initial creation |
```

### Archiving Old Versions
- Keep previous versions in `/Knowledge Base/Battlecards/Archive/`
- Naming convention: `Battlecard - [Category] - v1.0.txt`
- Current version always lives at the main file path without version suffix

---

## 4. Adding New Battlecards

### When to Create a New Battlecard
- A new competitor category is frequently encountered in sales
- Existing battlecards don't cover the comparison adequately
- Sales requests a specific battlecard based on deal patterns

### New Battlecard Process
1. Review existing Knowledge Base documents for relevant positioning
2. Interview sales team on common objections and scenarios
3. Draft battlecard following standard 11-section structure
4. Review with sales lead and at least 2 reps
5. Add to Battlecard Index
6. Announce to sales team

### Required Sections (All New Battlecards Must Include)
1. Anchor Statement
2. Competitive Context
3. Core Differentiation Pillars (3 minimum)
4. Worldview Comparison
5. Key Reframe Questions (4-6)
6. Proof Points & Evidence
7. Common Objections & Reframes (3 minimum)
8. Win Scenarios
9. Lose / Walk-Away Scenarios
10. Language & Framing Guidance
11. Closing Anchor

---

## 5. Alignment Requirements

### All Battlecards Must Align With:
- `1 Product Overview.txt` — Core positioning and philosophy
- `5 Value Proposition & Messaging.txt` — Message pillars
- `8 Objections_FAQ.txt` — Objection handling frameworks
- `11 Competitive Positioning.txt` — Differentiation pillars

### Alignment Check Questions:
- Does this claim appear in the Knowledge Base?
- Is the language consistent with Value Proposition messaging?
- Does the objection reframe follow the Objections document framework?
- Does the positioning match Competitive Positioning pillars?

**Rule:** No battlecard should introduce new claims not already supported in the Knowledge Base. If a new claim is needed, update the source document first, then the battlecard.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "The battlecard doesn't cover my situation"
- Document the specific scenario
- Submit feedback with the new objection/comparison
- Marketing will assess for next update or new battlecard

### "The reframe didn't work"
- Note what the prospect said in response
- Suggest alternative language that might work better
- Submit feedback for review

### "Competitor has changed their positioning"
- Flag immediately to marketing
- Include links/evidence of the new positioning
- Triggered review will assess need for updates
