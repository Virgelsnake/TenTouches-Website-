# Ten Touches – Features & Capabilities

What It Does (Without Marketing Fluff)

This supports demos, onboarding, and comparisons.


## 1. Client Cards

*Reference: Screenshot 1 – Client Detail Screen*

### Relationship-First Data Model

Every client in Ten Touches is stored as a *relationship memory surface*, not a contact record. The data model captures both professional and personal information in a structured, searchable format.

**Business Information:**
- Full name with prominent display
- Company and position/role
- Email and phone number
- Tap-to-use contact details (mobile-optimised)

**Personal Information:**
- Sports played and followed
- Teams supported
- Pets (type, name, breed)
- Other memorable details that make the relationship real

This dual structure mirrors how humans actually remember people — not by job title alone, but by the details that made them memorable.

### Search by Any Remembered Attribute

Traditional CRMs let you search by name, company, or email. Ten Touches lets you search by anything you remembered:

- "Who was the beagle owner?"
- "Which client supports Man United?"
- "Who plays cricket?"

This means you can reconnect with people even when you've forgotten their name but remember something about them.

### Personal Detail Emphasis

The client card prioritises human details alongside business information. Personal data is:
- **Structured** — not buried in free-text notes
- **Searchable** — indexed for quick retrieval
- **Contextual** — displayed with icons and labels for instant recognition

### Information Hierarchy

The card layout follows a deliberate order:
1. **Identity** — Who is this person? (name, photo if available)
2. **Business context** — Where do they work and what do they do?
3. **Personal context** — What makes them human?
4. **Relationship quality** — How strong is this relationship? (see Client Quality Scoring)

No clutter. No fields-for-the-sake-of-fields. Only what helps you recognise and reconnect.


## 2. Voice Input Engine

### Why Voice?

The moment after a conversation is when insight is freshest. Typing on a phone is slow and awkward. Voice is natural, fast, and captures nuance that typing loses.

Ten Touches makes voice the primary input method for speed, accuracy, and real-world usability.

### Creating Clients via Voice

Speak a new client into existence:

> "Add Daniel O'Connor, Director at GreenForge Solutions. Email daniel@greenforge.com. He plays cricket, supports Ireland and Man United, has two dogs called Charlie and Buddy — a Beagle and a Labrador."

The system parses this into structured fields automatically. No form-filling required.

### Logging Touches via Voice

Record what happened immediately after a call or meeting:

> "Just had a call with Daniel. Discussed the cybersecurity audit proposal. He's interested but wants to see case studies and our ISO certification. Schedule a follow-up call for next Thursday."

This captures:
- What happened
- Key details and objections
- Next action

All without opening a laptop.

### Creating Opportunities via Voice

Start tracking a deal the moment it becomes real:

> "Create opportunity: Cybersecurity Audit for GreenForge Solutions. Value eighteen thousand pounds. Currently at prospect stage."

The opportunity is created, linked to the client, and ready for tracking.

### Field Auto-Population

Voice input isn't just transcription. The system interprets what you say and populates the correct fields:
- Names go to name fields
- Emails go to email fields
- Companies go to company fields
- Personal details are categorised appropriately

You speak naturally. The system structures it correctly.


## 3. Touch Tracking

### What Is a Touch?

A "touch" is any meaningful interaction with a client. It's the fundamental unit of relationship maintenance in Ten Touches.

Touches include:
- Phone calls
- Emails
- SMS messages
- Meetings (in-person or virtual)
- LinkedIn messages
- Casual check-ins (coffee, events)
- Any other intentional contact

### Historical Touches

Every touch is logged with:
- **Date and time** — When it happened
- **Touch type** — How you connected (call, email, meeting, etc.)
- **Context** — What you discussed or the purpose
- **Linked opportunity** — If relevant to a specific deal

This creates a complete interaction history for every client, eliminating the need to search email threads or calendar entries.

### Future Planned Touches (Reminders)

*Reference: Screenshot 3 – Reminders Take Action Today*

Ten Touches doesn't just track what happened — it helps you plan what's next.

Future touches are scheduled with:
- **Specific date and time** — When you intend to reach out
- **Touch type** — What kind of interaction you're planning
- **Intent** — Why you're reaching out (e.g., "Check in after implementation")
- **Linked client and opportunity** — Full context at a glance

### Time/Date Tagging

Every touch — past or future — is anchored to a specific point in time. This enables:
- Chronological timelines per client
- Overdue visibility without aggressive warnings
- Pattern analysis (how often do you touch this client?)

### Touch Types

Ten Touches supports multiple touch types, each with its own icon and category:

- **SMS** — Quick text messages
- **Phone Call** — Voice conversations
- **Email** — Written correspondence
- **Meeting** — Scheduled face-to-face or video calls
- **LinkedIn** — Professional network engagement
- **Tweet** — Social media interaction
- **Casual** — Coffee, lunch, events, informal catch-ups
- **Event** — Conferences, networking events, seminars

This categorisation powers the GTD-style filtering (see Section 5) and the Optimise dashboard insights (see Section 6).


## 4. Opportunity Management

*Reference: Screenshots 2 & 4 – Opportunities Dashboard & Opportunity Detail*

### Opportunity Cards

Each opportunity is displayed as a self-contained card showing:
- **Opportunity name** — The product, service, or deal
- **Client name** — Who you're selling to
- **Total deal value** — The headline number
- **Progress indicator** — Visual confidence ring with numeric score
- **Colour-coded outline** — Visual differentiation between opportunities

Cards are designed for quick scanning on mobile. No tables, no columns, no density overload.

### Revenue Value Tracking

Every opportunity tracks two numbers:

1. **Total Value** — The full potential worth of the deal (e.g., £18,000)
2. **Risked Revenue** — The probability-weighted value based on current stage (e.g., £4,500 at 25% confidence)

This dual display prevents self-delusion. You see both what you *hope* to win and what you *probably* will win.

### Four-Stage Risk Weighting

Ten Touches uses a simple, universally understood progression model:

| Stage | Confidence | Risked Revenue |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| **Prospect** | 25% | Quarter of total value |
| **Proposal** | 50% | Half of total value |
| **PO** | 75% | Three-quarters of total value |
| **Paid** | 100% | Full value |

This model is:
- **Easy to explain** — Anyone can understand "We're at proposal, so it's worth half"
- **Honest** — No fake precision or probability percentages to argue about
- **Actionable** — Each stage implies clear progression criteria

### Status Tracking

Opportunities have three possible statuses:
- **Live** — Active, still being pursued
- **Won** — Successfully closed (typically when reaching Paid stage)
- **Lost** — No longer viable

Status is separate from stage. A deal can be advanced but lost, or early but promising. This reflects reality better than binary CRM logic.

### Sorting and Filtering

The Opportunities Dashboard supports sorting by:
- **Client** — Group deals by who you're selling to
- **Touch** — Sort by engagement level
- **Value** — Prioritise by deal size
- **Product** — Group by what you're selling

Each sort has directional toggle (ascending/descending) for flexible mental grouping.


## 5. GTD-Inspired Actions

*Reference: Screenshot 3 – Reminders Take Action Today*

### The Philosophy

Ten Touches applies Getting Things Done (GTD) principles to sales follow-up. Instead of organising by priority or urgency, actions are organised by *context* — the conditions needed to do them.

This lets you match your actions to your energy and environment rather than fighting a static to-do list.

### Context-Based Filtering

The "Take Action Today" screen presents a filter bar with touch types:

- **All** — See everything
- **SMS** — Quick messages
- **Phone Call** — Voice conversations
- **Email** — Written follow-ups
- **Meeting** — Scheduled engagements
- **LinkedIn** — Professional network actions
- **Tweet** — Social media tasks
- **Casual** — Informal check-ins
- **Event** — Conference and networking follow-ups

Tap a category, and only relevant actions appear. No scrolling through irrelevant tasks.

### Touch-Type Views

Each filter creates a focused execution mode:

- **Got 10 minutes between meetings?** → Tap SMS, knock out quick messages
- **In the car or walking?** → Tap Phone Call, make calls hands-free
- **At your desk with focus time?** → Tap Email, write thoughtful responses
- **Energy for relationship building?** → Tap Casual, schedule coffee or check-ins

This approach removes the "What should I do now?" decision fatigue.

### Daily Execution Focus

The screen header says "Take Action Today" — not "Your Tasks" or "To-Do List."

This framing:
- Emphasises *doing*, not managing
- Focuses on the present, not the backlog
- Invites action without pressure

Overdue items are visible but not aggressive. No shame language. No flashing warnings. Still calm, still usable.

### Action Card Structure

Each reminder card includes:
- **Action type** — Icon and label showing the touch type
- **Associated opportunity** — What deal this relates to (if any)
- **Client name** — Who you're contacting
- **Due date and time** — When you planned to do this
- **Free-text intent** — Why you're reaching out (e.g., "Check in after implementation")
- **Visual urgency cue** — Subtle colour for overdue items

Everything you need to act is on the card. No need to open multiple records.


## 6. Dashboards & Insights

*Reference: Screenshot 5 – Optimise Dashboard*

The Optimise dashboard is a behavioural intelligence layer designed for the individual seller, not management oversight. It turns everyday sales activity into self-coaching.

### Daily Touch Targets

**Question answered:** "Am I showing up consistently?"

Features:
- User-defined activity target (e.g., 3 touches per 14 days)
- Toggle to enable or disable tracking
- Simple +/- controls to adjust targets
- Clear "Below Target" or "On Track" indicators

This focuses on activity rhythm, not raw volume. Consistency matters more than spikes of effort.

### Activity vs Target Tracking

**Question answered:** "How am I doing over time?"

Features:
- Bar chart showing touches completed over time
- Visual comparison against your target
- Trend visibility without spreadsheets

This makes momentum visible at a glance and encourages habit-building without turning activity into a quota.

### Pick Winners (Winning Touch Identification)

**Question answered:** "Which actions actually work for me?"

Features:
- Touch types displayed as icons
- Win rate per touch type
- Performance delta (+ / – points vs average)
- Sample size visibility (n=)

This shows which actions perform best *when you use them* and highlights underused high-performing touch types.

Instead of generic advice like "make more calls," Ten Touches tells you: "When *you* do this, it works."

### Match the Moment Analysis

**Question answered:** "What works best at different stages of a deal?"

Features:
- Separate views for First Touch and Last Touch
- Win rate by touch type at each stage
- Visual contrast between strong openers and strong closers

This reveals that timing matters as much as action. The same touch type can succeed or fail depending on the moment.

### Sell Faster

**Question answered:** "Which actions close deals with fewer touches and less time?"

Features:
- Average number of touches required to win per touch type
- Average days to win per touch type
- Side-by-side comparison across channels

This identifies the most efficient sales actions and helps reduce deal drag. Users learn how to win with less effort, not more.

### Value Impact

**Question answered:** "Which actions show up in the revenue I actually win?"

Features:
- Percentage contribution of each touch type to won revenue
- Sample size indicators
- Clear revenue correlation signals

This connects behaviour directly to outcomes and reinforces high-value actions.

### Core Metrics & Outcomes

**Question answered:** "How am I doing overall?"

Features:
- Conversion rate
- Average touches per deal
- Won vs lost comparison
- List of won and lost opportunities for reflection

This grounds insights in real outcomes and encourages reflection without overwhelm.


## 7. Client Quality Scoring

*Reference: Screenshot 1 – Client Detail Screen*

### The Four-Star System

Every client card includes four distinct quality ratings, each scored with a visual star system:

| Dimension | What It Measures |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Testimonials** | Has this client provided written or video endorsements? |
| **Referrals** | Has this client introduced you to others? |
| **Feedback** | Has this client given structured feedback on your work? |
| **Repeat Business** | Has this client bought from you more than once? |

Each star is:
- **Individually scored** — Separate rating per dimension
- **Visually obvious** — Filled vs unfilled stars
- **Quantified** — Number inside star shows count/score

### Behavioural Nudges Without Pressure

The star system doesn't shame — it guides.

Glancing at a client card, you instantly see:
- "I've had repeat business but no testimonials"
- "This client refers people, but I've never asked formally"
- "Great relationship, but no structured feedback yet"

This quietly prompts better selling behaviour without creating a task list or compliance burden.

### Why This Matters

Most CRMs track deal value. Ten Touches tracks relationship quality.

High-quality clients — those who refer, endorse, and return — are worth more than one-time buyers. The four-star system makes this visible and actionable.
