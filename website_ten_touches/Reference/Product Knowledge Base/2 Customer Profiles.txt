# Ten Touches – Ideal Customer Profiles

Who This Is Really For

This drives targeting, messaging, pricing, and sales qualification.


## 1. Primary ICP: Relationship-Driven Sellers

These are individuals who build their book of business through genuine relationships, not scripts or volume. They sell through trust, not transactions.

### Specific Roles

**Business Development Professionals**
- Work in B2B services, consulting, or complex sales
- Build pipelines through networking, referrals, and relationship cultivation
- Often attend events, conferences, and industry gatherings
- Success depends on being remembered and trusted

**Founders and Entrepreneurs**
- Running their own sales process while juggling product, hiring, and operations
- No dedicated sales support — they are the sales team
- High stakes on every deal; can't afford to drop relationships
- Often charismatic but disorganised

**Consultants and Advisors**
- Long sales cycles with high-value engagements
- Repeat business and referrals are the lifeblood
- Relationship quality directly impacts revenue
- Need to remember client context across months or years

**Sales Leaders Who Sell**
- Player-coaches who carry their own quota
- Want to lead by example, not just manage dashboards
- Need tools that work for them personally, not just for their team
- Often frustrated by the CRMs they ask others to use

**Account Managers**
- Maintain and grow existing client relationships
- Success measured by retention, expansion, and referrals
- Need to remember personal details across large portfolios
- Follow-up consistency is critical

### Typical Environments

- **Small to mid-sized companies** (1-200 employees) where individuals own relationships
- **Professional services firms** (consulting, legal, financial services, marketing agencies)
- **B2B SaaS companies** with relationship-led sales motions
- **Startups** where founders are doing their own selling
- **Networks and communities** where relationship capital matters

### Key Frustrations

- "I know relationships matter, but I can't keep track of everyone"
- "My CRM is designed for my manager, not for me"
- "I spend more time on data entry than on actual selling"
- "I forget to follow up, and deals slip away"
- "I can't remember what we talked about last time"
- "I have no idea which of my actions actually lead to wins"

### What Success Looks Like to Them

- Walking into every conversation informed and confident
- Never forgetting a follow-up or letting a relationship go cold
- Understanding their own selling patterns and improving over time
- Feeling like their CRM actually helps them, not just tracks them
- Building a reputation as someone who remembers and cares


## 2. Secondary ICP: Sales Managers & Leaders

Sales managers care about visibility, but they also care about adoption. Ten Touches solves both — by making the tool valuable to the people using it.

### What They Care About

**Pipeline Visibility**
- Where do deals actually stand?
- What's at risk, and why?
- Is the pipeline growing or shrinking?

**Activity Consistency**
- Are team members following up consistently?
- Are relationships being maintained or neglected?
- Is activity leading to outcomes?

**Data Quality**
- Is the CRM data accurate and complete?
- Can they trust what they see in reports?
- Are team members actually using the tool?

**Coaching Opportunities**
- Which behaviours lead to wins?
- Where are team members struggling?
- How can they help without micromanaging?

### Why Ten Touches Helps Without "CRM Policing"

Traditional CRMs create a compliance dynamic: managers push for data entry, salespeople resist, and everyone loses.

Ten Touches breaks this cycle:
- **Users want to use it** because it helps them personally
- **Data quality improves** because capture is easy and immediate
- **Visibility emerges naturally** from genuine usage, not forced compliance

Managers don't have to chase data. They get visibility because their team actually uses the tool.

### Visibility Without Micromanagement

Ten Touches provides insight without surveillance:
- See activity patterns without checking every call
- Understand pipeline health without interrogating deal stages
- Identify coaching moments from outcome data, not activity logs

The philosophy: **help the individual, and the team benefits**.


## 3. Buying Triggers

These are the events, moments, or realisations that make someone actively seek a solution like Ten Touches.

### CRM Fatigue

**The trigger:** Someone has tried Salesforce, HubSpot, Pipedrive, or another CRM and found it overwhelming, under-used, or actively unhelpful.

**What they say:**
- "We bought Salesforce and nobody uses it"
- "I hate opening my CRM"
- "It takes longer to log the call than to make the call"

**Why Ten Touches resonates:** It's designed to be used, not tolerated.

### Scaling Sales Efforts

**The trigger:** A founder or small team is growing and can no longer rely on memory alone. Relationships are starting to slip through the cracks.

**What they say:**
- "I used to remember everyone. Now I can't keep track"
- "We're growing, but our sales process is chaos"
- "I need a system before we hire more salespeople"

**Why Ten Touches resonates:** It provides structure without bureaucracy.

### Poor Follow-Up Discipline

**The trigger:** Someone realises they're losing deals because they don't follow up consistently. They know the problem but haven't found a solution.

**What they say:**
- "I'm great at first meetings, terrible at follow-up"
- "I know I should call them back, but I keep forgetting"
- "Deals die because I get busy"

**Why Ten Touches resonates:** Reminders by context make follow-up feel natural, not forced.

### Founder-Led Sales Chaos

**The trigger:** A founder is doing sales while running the company. They're stretched thin and dropping balls.

**What they say:**
- "I don't have time for a complicated CRM"
- "I need something I can use on my phone between meetings"
- "I just need to stop forgetting people"

**Why Ten Touches resonates:** Voice-first, mobile-first design fits their reality.

### Relationship Decay

**The trigger:** Someone notices that important relationships have gone cold because they didn't maintain them.

**What they say:**
- "I used to have a great relationship with them — what happened?"
- "They stopped referring people to me"
- "I can't remember the last time I reached out"

**Why Ten Touches resonates:** Momentum tracking and reminders prevent decay.

### New Role or Territory

**The trigger:** Someone starts a new job or takes on a new territory and needs to build relationships from scratch.

**What they say:**
- "I have 200 new contacts and no context on any of them"
- "I need to hit the ground running"
- "I can't afford to forget anyone"

**Why Ten Touches resonates:** Relationship memory helps accelerate ramp-up.


## 4. Anti-ICP (Who It's Not For)

Being clear about who Ten Touches is *not* for helps with qualification and prevents mismatched expectations.

### High-Volume Transactional Call Centres

**Why they're not a fit:**
- They optimise for call volume, not relationship depth
- They need dialers, scripts, and automation
- Individual relationship memory doesn't scale to their model

**What they need instead:** Outbound sales platforms, auto-dialers, sequence tools

### Teams That Want Rigid Pipeline Enforcement

**Why they're not a fit:**
- They want mandatory fields, stage gates, and approval workflows
- They prioritise process compliance over user experience
- They view CRM as a control mechanism, not a support tool

**What they need instead:** Enterprise CRMs with heavy customisation and enforcement

### Organisations Optimising for Reporting Only

**Why they're not a fit:**
- They care about dashboards for leadership, not tools for sellers
- They'll sacrifice user experience for data structure
- They see CRM adoption as a compliance problem, not a value problem

**What they need instead:** BI tools layered on top of traditional CRMs

### Anyone Expecting Full Enterprise Features

**Why they're not a fit:**
- They need complex integrations, custom objects, and workflow automation
- They want territory management, lead routing, and marketing automation
- They measure CRM value by feature breadth, not user adoption

**What they need instead:** Salesforce, HubSpot Enterprise, Microsoft Dynamics

### Signals to Disqualify

Use these as qualification signals in sales conversations:
- "Can we enforce mandatory fields?"
- "We need approval workflows for deal stages"
- "How does it integrate with our marketing automation?"
- "We have 500 salespeople — can it handle that?"
- "Our main goal is better forecasting reports for leadership"


## 5. Buyer vs User Distinction

In many cases, the person who buys Ten Touches is different from the person who uses it. Messaging must address both.

### Who Buys

**Individual Contributors (Self-Purchase)**
- Founders buying for themselves
- Salespeople frustrated with company CRM
- Consultants managing their own practice
- Anyone with budget authority over their own tools

**Decision Criteria:**
- Does it solve *my* problem?
- Is it easy to start using immediately?
- Is the price worth the personal benefit?

**Messaging Focus:**
- Personal productivity and relationship memory
- Immediate value, low friction
- "Finally, a CRM built for you, not your manager"

**Sales Managers / Team Leads (Team Purchase)**
- Buying for a small team (2-20 people)
- Looking for adoption-first solutions
- Frustrated with low CRM usage on their team

**Decision Criteria:**
- Will my team actually use this?
- Will I get visibility without enforcement?
- Is it worth the per-seat cost?

**Messaging Focus:**
- Adoption rates and user satisfaction
- Visibility without micromanagement
- "Your team will actually use this one"

### Who Uses

**Primary Users:**
- Individual salespeople, account managers, BD professionals
- Daily usage for capture, reminders, and client lookup
- Success = feels helpful, not burdensome

**Secondary Users:**
- Managers checking pipeline and activity
- Occasional usage for coaching and review
- Success = visibility without chasing

### How Messaging Differs

| Audience | Primary Message | Proof Points |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Individual Seller** | "Remember everyone, follow up consistently, sell smarter" | Voice input, relationship memory, personal insights |
| **Sales Manager** | "Your team will actually use this — and you'll get visibility" | Adoption focus, honest pipeline, no enforcement needed |
| **Founder** | "A CRM that works the way you work" | Mobile-first, voice-first, no admin overhead |

### Pricing Implications

- **Individual plans** should feel accessible to self-purchasers
- **Team plans** should demonstrate per-seat value to managers
- **Free trials** should prove value quickly to both buyers and users
