## 2. Sales Motion Overview

### Primary Sales Motion

Ten Touches follows a **product-led, relationship-assisted** sales motion:

1. **Discovery** — Prospect discovers Ten Touches through content, referral, or search
2. **Self-exploration** — Prospect explores website, watches demo, reads materials
3. **Trial** — Prospect signs up for free trial and experiences the product
4. **Assisted conversion** — Light-touch sales support helps with questions and objections
5. **Expansion** — Happy users recommend to colleagues, teams expand usage

This is not high-pressure enterprise sales. It's not pure self-serve either. It's a blend that respects the relationship-first philosophy.

### Typical Buyer Journey Stages

| Stage | Buyer Mindset | Key Questions | Primary Asset |
|-------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Awareness** | "I have a CRM problem" | "Is there something better?" | Website, content |
| **Interest** | "This sounds different" | "How does it actually work?" | Demo video, use cases |
| **Evaluation** | "Can this work for me?" | "Will my team use it?" | Trial, objection handling |
| **Decision** | "Should I commit?" | "What's the ROI?" | Pricing narrative, case studies |
| **Adoption** | "How do I succeed?" | "How do I get started?" | Onboarding, quick start |

## 3. Core Sales Narratives

Every sales conversation should be anchored in one of these narratives. Choose based on the prospect's primary pain.

### Primary Narrative: "CRM for the Person Doing the Work"

**Use when:** The prospect is frustrated with CRM adoption failure or feels their current tool serves management, not users.

**The story:**
> "Most CRMs are built for managers who want visibility. They demand data entry but give nothing back to the salesperson. Ten Touches flips this — it's designed to help the person actually doing the selling. When the tool is valuable to the user, adoption follows naturally. Management gets visibility as a byproduct, not a demand."

**Key proof points:**
- Voice capture removes data entry friction
- Personal insights help the seller improve
- Reminders match energy and context

### Supporting Narrative 1: "Relationship Memory, Not Contact Records"

**Use when:** The prospect sells through genuine human connection and values personal details.

**The story:**
> "Traditional CRMs store job titles and company names. Ten Touches preserves relationships — sports, pets, interests, the human details that make connections real. You can search for 'beagle owner' or 'Man United fan' and find the right person. That's how humans actually remember people."

**Key proof points:**
- Personal information fields on client cards
- Search by any remembered attribute
- Four-star quality scoring prompts relationship actions

### Supporting Narrative 2: "Self-Coaching Through Insight"

**Use when:** The prospect wants to improve their selling effectiveness, not just track activity.

**The story:**
> "Instead of generic advice like 'make more calls,' Ten Touches shows you which actions actually work — for you, specifically. Which touch types lead to your wins? What works at different stages? How can you sell faster? That's self-coaching, not compliance reporting."

**Key proof points:**
- Pick Winners — win rate by touch type
- Match the Moment — stage-appropriate actions
- Sell Faster — efficiency metrics

### Supporting Narrative 3: "Reducing Friction, Not Enforcing Process"

**Use when:** The prospect fears that new tools create more work, not less.

**The story:**
> "Ten Touches doesn't add process — it removes friction. You capture by speaking, not typing. Reminders carry context so you don't have to reconstruct intent. The goal is momentum, not compliance. It fits in the margins of your day, not the centre of your admin."

**Key proof points:**
- Voice-first capture
- Context-rich reminders
- Mobile-first design

### When to Use Each Narrative

| Prospect Situation | Lead With |
|--------------------|-----------|
| CRM adoption has failed | "CRM for the person doing the work" |
| Sells through relationships | "Relationship memory" |
| Wants to improve performance | "Self-coaching through insight" |
| Fears more admin burden | "Reducing friction" |

## 7. Metrics for Enablement Effectiveness

Track these metrics to understand whether enablement is working:

### Sales Cycle Metrics

- **Time to first conversation** — How quickly do prospects engage?
- **Sales cycle length** — Is it getting shorter or longer?
- **Number of touches to close** — Are we efficient?

### Conversion Metrics

- **Demo-to-trial conversion** — Are demos compelling?
- **Trial-to-paid conversion** — Is the product delivering on promises?
- **Win rate** — Are we closing deals we should be winning?

### Objection Metrics

- **Objection frequency** — Which objections come up most?
- **Objection resolution rate** — Are we handling them effectively?
- **Lost deal reasons** — Why are we losing when we lose?

### Asset Usage Metrics

- **Which assets are used** — What's helping sales?
- **Which assets are ignored** — What needs improvement or removal?
- **Feedback quality** — Are we learning from the field?

### Targets and Benchmarks

*Note: Specific targets should be set based on baseline data and business goals.*

## 8. What We Do Not Build (By Design)

Ten Touches sales enablement is intentionally lean. We avoid:

### Overly Long Pitch Decks

**Why:** Long decks signal insecurity. If you need 50 slides to explain your product, you don't understand your value proposition.

**Instead:** Maximum 15 slides. Lead with problem and philosophy. Let the product speak.

### Feature Comparison Spreadsheets

**Why:** Feature-for-feature comparison invites commoditisation. We don't win by having more checkboxes.

**Instead:** Narrative comparisons focused on philosophy, behavioural impact, and adoption drivers.

*Cross-reference: Document 10 — Competitive Positioning*

### Scripted Talk Tracks

**Why:** Scripts sound scripted. They remove authenticity and prevent adaptation to the prospect.

**Instead:** Frameworks and narratives that guide conversation without dictating words.

### Heavy Documentation for Its Own Sake

**Why:** More documentation isn't better documentation. Sales teams won't read walls of text.

**Instead:** Concise, actionable materials that can be consumed in minutes, not hours.

### Manipulation Tactics

**Why:** Pressure tactics contradict the relationship-first philosophy. We don't want to trick people into buying.

**Instead:** Honest conversations about fit. Confident walk-aways when it's not right.

## 9. Alignment With Product & Marketing

Sales enablement must stay aligned with product reality and marketing messaging. No disconnects.

### Alignment With Product

**Principle:** Never promise what the product can't deliver.

**Practices:**
- Sales reviews significant product changes before launch
- Demo scripts reference actual screens, not mockups
- Objection handling is grounded in real capabilities
- Feature requests flow back to product for prioritisation

### Alignment With Website Messaging

**Principle:** Website and sales conversations should feel like the same company.

**Practices:**
- Value proposition consistency across all touchpoints
- Same language, same proof points, same philosophy
- Website content reviewed against sales feedback
- Landing pages reflect actual sales narratives

### Alignment With In-App Experience

**Principle:** First use should confirm what sales promised.

**Practices:**
- Onboarding reinforces sales messaging
- In-app copy matches external language
- Feature names are consistent everywhere
- Help content references sales use cases

### Preventing Disconnects

Common disconnects to watch for:
- **Overpromising** — Sales claims features that don't exist
- **Underpromising** — Sales misses key value that product delivers
- **Language drift** — Different terms in sales vs product vs marketing
- **Philosophy drift** — Sales slipping into feature-led or pressure tactics


---

## 10. Key Takeaway

**The guiding principle for all sales enablement:**

> **Every sales asset should help the prospect understand whether Ten Touches genuinely solves their problem — and feel respected whether they buy or not.**

If an asset doesn't serve this purpose, it doesn't belong.

Sales enablement is not about convincing people to buy things they don't need. It's about:
- Helping the right people find the right solution
- Communicating value honestly and clearly
- Enabling confident decisions — including decisions not to buy
- Building trust that outlasts any individual transaction

When sales enablement is done right, customers arrive already understanding the value, already trusting the philosophy, and already feeling like Ten Touches was built for them.

That's the goal.
