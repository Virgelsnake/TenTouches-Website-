# Ten Touches – Value Proposition & Messaging

Messaging Framework

This is where sales and marketing finally align.


## 1. Core Value Proposition

### Primary Promise

**Ten Touches helps relationship-driven salespeople remember everyone, follow up consistently, and sell smarter — without the admin burden of traditional CRMs.**

This promise addresses three core needs:
1. **Remember everyone** — Relationship memory that captures who people really are
2. **Follow up consistently** — Contextual reminders that make follow-up natural
3. **Sell smarter** — Insights that show what actually works for you

### Emotional Payoff

**"I finally feel in control of my relationships."**

Ten Touches delivers emotional relief from:
- The guilt of forgotten follow-ups
- The anxiety of walking into conversations unprepared
- The resentment of CRM work that feels like punishment
- The frustration of not knowing what's actually working

Users feel:
- **Confident** — They know who people are before every conversation
- **Organised** — They have a system that actually works for them
- **Effective** — They understand their own selling patterns
- **Valued** — The tool helps them, not just their manager

### Functional Payoff

**"I remember more, follow up better, and understand what wins deals."**

Ten Touches delivers practical value through:
- **Better conversations** — Personal details at your fingertips
- **Fewer missed opportunities** — Reminders that match your context and energy
- **Clearer pipeline** — Honest confidence levels, not fake precision
- **Personal insights** — Data on which actions lead to your wins
- **Less admin time** — Voice capture instead of form-filling
