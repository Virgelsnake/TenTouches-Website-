# Ten Touches – Visual & Demo Guidance

Making It Land

A great demo doesn't show features — it tells a story that the prospect sees themselves in.


## Introduction

This document provides guidance for anyone demonstrating Ten Touches — whether in a sales call, at a conference, in a video, or during onboarding.

The principles here are designed to:
- Create emotional resonance before feature explanation
- Show the product through the lens of relationship-building
- Avoid common demo mistakes that lose attention
- Ensure consistency across all visual communications

Remember: **Show the transformation, not just the tool.**

## 1. Core Screens to Show

These are the screens that best communicate the Ten Touches value proposition. Each serves a specific purpose in the demo narrative.

### Client Card (Screenshot 1)

**File reference:** `Reference/Screenshots/1 Search Client Detail Screenshot.png`

**What it shows:**
- Full client profile with business and personal details
- Four-star quality scoring (testimonials, referrals, feedback, repeat)
- Personal information (sports, pets, interests)
- Clean, relationship-first layout

**Why it matters in a demo:**
- Immediately differentiates from traditional CRM contact records
- Shows the "relationship memory" concept visually
- Demonstrates searchable personal details
- Reveals behavioural nudges through star ratings

**Key talking points:**
- "This isn't a contact record — it's a relationship memory surface"
- "You can search by 'beagle owner' or 'Man United fan' and find the right person"
- "The stars quietly prompt better behaviour — ask for testimonials, request referrals"

**Demo moment:**
Open a client card and spend 5 seconds orienting. Point out the personal details. Ask: "Imagine walking into every conversation knowing this."


### Opportunities Dashboard (Screenshot 2)

**File reference:** `Reference/Screenshots/2 Opportunities Screenshot.png`

**What it shows:**
- Card-based opportunity list
- Total value and confidence indicators
- Visual progress rings
- Mobile-optimised layout

**Why it matters in a demo:**
- Shows pipeline at a glance without spreadsheet complexity
- Demonstrates honest confidence vs fake precision
- Proves mobile-first design thinking
- Reveals emotional honesty about deal status

**Key talking points:**
- "In 10 seconds, you know what's live, what's big, what's close, what's weak"
- "The confidence score tells you the truth — no inflated forecasts"
- "This works in a lift, between meetings, before a call"

**Demo moment:**
Show the dashboard and ask: "What would it mean to have this clarity about your pipeline — on your phone, in seconds?"


### Reminders / Action List (Screenshot 3)

**File reference:** `Reference/Screenshots/3 Reminders Organised by Action Type.png`

**What it shows:**
- "Take Action Today" header
- Action-type filter bar (SMS, Phone Call, Email, Meeting, Casual, etc.)
- Context-rich reminder cards
- Overdue visibility without shame

**Why it matters in a demo:**
- Demonstrates GTD-style context filtering
- Shows how actions match energy and environment
- Proves the system carries context (who, why, what, when)
- Differentiates from generic task managers

**Key talking points:**
- "Got 10 minutes? Tap SMS and knock out quick messages. In the car? Tap Phone Call."
- "Every reminder includes full context — you never have to reconstruct intent"
- "This isn't a task list — it's a context-aware execution engine"

**Demo moment:**
Tap a filter (e.g., Phone Call) and show how the list narrows. Say: "The tool matches your work to your energy."


### Opportunity Detail (Screenshot 4)

**File reference:** `Reference/Screenshots/4 Opportunity Detail.png`

**What it shows:**
- Total value and risked revenue side by side
- Four-stage progress model (Prospect → Proposal → PO → Paid)
- Confidence indicator
- Voice input button
- Notes section

**Why it matters in a demo:**

- Proves the product prevents self-delusion

**Key talking points:**
- "You see the truth: £18k potential, but only £4.5k probable at this stage"
- "The moment after a call, tap record and capture objections, next steps, insights"
- "No fake precision — just honest confidence"

**Demo moment:**
Point to the risked revenue and say: "This is the number that matters. This keeps you honest."


### Optimise Dashboard (Screenshot 5)

**What it shows:**
- Activity target and momentum tracking
- Pick Winners — win rate by touch type
- Match the Moment — first touch vs last touch analysis
- Sell Faster — touches and time to win
- Value Impact — revenue correlation

**Why it matters in a demo:**
- Shows behavioural insight, not just reporting
- Demonstrates personal pattern recognition
- Proves the tool coaches without prescribing
- Delivers the "insight payoff" that completes the value loop

**Key talking points:**
- "This tells you which actions actually work — for you, specifically"
- "Instead of 'make more calls,' it says 'when you do this, you win'"
- "This isn't for your manager — it's for you"

**Demo moment:**
Pause on Pick Winners and say: "What if you knew exactly which actions lead to your wins?"

## 2. Demo Flow

A great demo follows a narrative arc: problem → solution → transformation. Don't start with features — start with a story.

### Recommended Demo Structure

**Step 1: Start with a human story (60 seconds)**

Begin with a scenario the prospect recognises:

> "Imagine you're at a conference. You meet a dozen people, have great conversations, exchange cards. Three days later, you're looking at a stack of business cards trying to remember: which one was the cricket fan? Who had the beagle? Who was interested in the cybersecurity project?"

Pause. Let it land.

> "That moment — when the details have faded and the follow-up feels hollow — that's the problem Ten Touches solves."

**Step 2: Show voice capture (90 seconds)**

Demonstrate the core capture experience:

> "At the event, you step aside for 30 seconds. You tap record and speak: 'Just met Daniel O'Connor, Director at GreenForge. Supports Man United, has two dogs. Interested in our cybersecurity audit. Follow up next week.'"

Show or simulate the result:
- Client card created
- Personal details captured
- Reminder scheduled

> "No forms. No fields. No laptop. The insight is captured in the moment, when it's fresh."

**Step 3: Show the relationship payoff (60 seconds)**

Open the client card (Screenshot 1):

> "Three days later, you open Ten Touches. Here's Daniel. You know exactly who he is — his role, his company, his dogs, his football team. Your follow-up email starts: 'How did United do at the weekend?' That's a conversation that lands."

**Step 4: Show the action payoff (60 seconds)**

Open the reminders screen (Screenshot 3):

> "You've got 30 minutes before your next meeting. You tap Email. Three follow-ups appear, each with full context. You knock them out in 20 minutes. Later, you're in the car — you tap Phone Call and make two calls while driving."

> "You're not doing CRM admin. You're just getting things done."

**Step 5: Show the insight payoff (90 seconds)**

Open the Optimise dashboard (Screenshot 5):

> "After a month, you check the dashboard. It shows you which actions actually lead to your wins. Not generic advice — your personal patterns. When you do meetings early, you win more. When you do casual check-ins, deals close faster."

> "This isn't reporting for your manager. It's self-coaching for you."

**Step 6: Close with the transformation (30 seconds)**

> "That's Ten Touches. You remember more, follow up better, and understand what works. The relationships that used to slip through the cracks become the deals that close."

**Total demo time: ~7 minutes**

## 3. Visual Language

Ten Touches uses visual design to communicate values without words. Understanding this helps you explain what prospects are seeing.

### Relationship Cues

**What to look for:**
- Personal information prominently displayed (not hidden in tabs)
- Human details (pets, sports, interests) treated as first-class data
- Client names large and clear
- No "contact" or "lead" language — always "client"

**What to say:**
> "Notice how the personal details are right here, not buried in a notes field. That's intentional. This is relationship memory, not data storage."

### Progress Indicators

**What to look for:**
- Circular confidence rings on opportunities
- Four-stage progress bars (Prospect → Proposal → PO → Paid)
- Activity momentum charts
- Star ratings for client quality

**What to say:**
> "These aren't vanity metrics. They're honest signals. The confidence ring tells you where you really are, not where you hope to be."

### Feedback Signals

**What to look for:**
- Colour-coded overdue indicators (red, but not aggressive)
- Below/above target indicators
- Win rate deltas (positive/negative)
- Sample size visibility on insights

**What to say:**
> "The app gives feedback without judgement. Overdue items are visible, but there's no shame language. The goal is momentum, not guilt."

### Mobile-First Design

**What to look for:**
- Large tap targets
- Card-based layouts
- Thumb-friendly navigation
- No desktop-style tables or dense grids

**What to say:**
> "Every screen is designed for a phone. This works in a lift, between meetings, in the car. It fits life in the field, not life behind a desk."

## 4. What Not to Show First

Some screens and features, while valuable, can derail a demo if shown too early. Avoid these until the core value is established.

### Admin Settings

**Why to avoid first:**
- Settings imply complexity
- Prospects may get distracted by configuration options
- Undermines the "simple to use" message

**When to show:**
- Only if the prospect specifically asks about customisation
- After the core demo is complete
- Position as "you can configure this, but most people don't need to"

### Raw Reports or Data Exports

**Why to avoid first:**
- Reports suggest management oversight, not user value
- Data exports feel technical and enterprise-y
- Shifts focus from relationship value to administrative capability

**When to show:**
- If the prospect is a manager asking about visibility
- After establishing that user value drives adoption
- Frame as "because people actually use it, the data is complete"

### Edge Cases or Power Features

**Why to avoid first:**
- Edge cases create confusion about core use
- Power features suggest a learning curve
- Complexity undermines the simplicity message

**When to show:**
- Only in response to specific questions
- After the core narrative is understood
- Frame as "and if you need this, it's there"

### Empty States or Setup Screens

**Why to avoid first:**
- Empty screens feel hollow and uncompelling
- Setup implies effort before value
- Breaks the immersion of the demo narrative

**When to show:**
- Never, if you can help it
- Always demo with realistic sample data
- If you must show setup, do it quickly and move to populated screens

## 5. Demo Principles

### Lead with empathy, not features

Start every demo by showing you understand the prospect's problem. Features are solutions — but solutions only matter when the problem is felt.

### Show, don't just tell

Don't say "you can capture by voice" — demonstrate it. Don't say "the insights are personal" — show the dashboard. Seeing is believing.

### Let the product breathe

Pause after showing a screen. Let the prospect absorb what they're seeing. Silence creates space for questions and recognition.

### Match the demo to the prospect

A founder cares about lightweight systems. A sales manager cares about adoption. An individual seller cares about personal value. Emphasise what matters to them.

### End with transformation, not features

The last thing they should remember isn't a feature — it's the outcome. "Remember more. Follow up better. Understand what works."

## 6. Common Demo Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | What to Do Instead |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| Starting with features | No emotional hook | Start with a human story |
| Showing everything | Overwhelms the prospect | Focus on 4-5 key screens |
| Talking too much | Prospect tunes out | Pause, ask questions, listen |
| Ignoring the prospect's context | Feels generic | Tailor the narrative to their role |
| Ending with a feature | Forgettable | End with the transformation |
