## 7. Quality Standards for Battlecards
A battlecard is considered “done” only if:
- A salesperson can use it mid-call without preparation
- It does not require a slide or screen share
- It avoids feature comparison tables
- It helps change how the buyer thinks, not just what they compare

## 8. Maintenance & Ownership
- Named owner (usually marketing)
- Review cadence
- Feedback loop from sales
- Versioning approach

## 9. Alignment With Other Documents
Battlecards must align with:
- Product overview
- Competitive positioning
- Sales enablement assets
- Demo scripts

No battlecard should introduce new claims not supported elsewhere.

## 10. Key Principle
- Battlecards exist to **win the conversation**, not the comparison.
