# Ten Touches – Use Cases & User Journeys

Stories Over Screens

This fuels demos, landing pages, and sales decks.


## Introduction

Every feature in Ten Touches exists to solve a real problem in a real moment. This document presents five core use cases — each with a narrative arc that shows the before, during, and after of using Ten Touches.

These stories are designed for:
- **Demos** — Show prospects their own reality
- **Landing pages** — Lead with empathy, not features
- **Sales decks** — Create emotional resonance before feature walkthroughs
- **Onboarding** — Help new users see themselves in the product

The key to each story: *show the transformation, not just the tool*.

## Use Case 1: Networking Event Follow-Up

**The scenario:** You attend a conference, meet a dozen interesting people, exchange cards, have great conversations — and then life takes over.

### Before Ten Touches

You leave the event energised. Your pocket is full of business cards. Your head is full of half-remembered conversations.

Then reality hits:
- Back-to-back meetings the next day
- A project deadline that can't wait
- Family commitments that take priority

By the time you sit down to "do the follow-up," three days have passed. You look at a stack of cards and think:

> "Which one was the person who liked cricket? Who had the beagle? Who was interested in the cybersecurity project?"

You spend an hour entering names into your CRM. You write generic follow-up emails that feel hollow. Half the people you met never hear from you again.

The result? Missed opportunities. Wasted effort. Guilt.

### During Ten Touches

At the event, between conversations, you step aside for 30 seconds. You tap the record button and speak:

> "Just met Daniel O'Connor, Director at GreenForge. Supports Man United, has two dogs — Charlie and Buddy. Interested in our cybersecurity audit. Follow up next week with case studies."

The client card is created. The personal details are captured. A reminder is scheduled. You slip your phone back in your pocket and return to the next conversation.

No forms. No fields. No friction.

*Reference: Screenshot 1 — Client Detail Screen (personal information capture)*

### After Ten Touches

Three days later, you open Ten Touches during a quiet moment. Your reminders show three event follow-ups due today — filtered by "Email" because you're at your desk.

Each reminder includes:
- The person's name and company
- The personal details you captured
- The specific opportunity discussed
- Your own words about what to do next

You write a follow-up that begins:

> "Great to meet you at the conference. How did United do at the weekend? As promised, here are those case studies..."

It takes two minutes. It feels personal. It lands.

*Reference: Screenshot 3 — Reminders Take Action Today (context-rich follow-up)*

### Outcome Achieved

**Without Ten Touches:** 12 business cards → 3 generic follow-ups → 0 meaningful conversations

**With Ten Touches:** 12 voice notes → 12 personalised follow-ups → 4 qualified opportunities → 1 closed deal

The difference isn't the technology. It's the timing. Insight captured in the moment becomes action that matters.

## Use Case 2: Founder-Led Sales

**The scenario:** You're a founder running your own sales process while also building product, managing the team, and keeping investors happy. Sales can't be a full-time job, but it can't be ignored either.

### Before Ten Touches

You're juggling everything. Your pipeline lives in:
- A spreadsheet you update monthly (when you remember)
- Email threads you search through before calls
- Your head — which is already at capacity

Every sales conversation starts with a silent scramble:

> "Wait, what did we discuss last time? Did I promise to send something? When was our last call?"

You wing it. Sometimes you get lucky. Sometimes the prospect notices.

Worse: deals slip through the cracks. You discover weeks later that you forgot to follow up on a warm lead. The guilt compounds:

> "I know relationships matter. I just can't keep track of them all."

### During Ten Touches

After each call, you spend 60 seconds with the record button:

> "Spoke to Sarah at TechFlow. She's interested in the enterprise plan but needs board approval. Husband's a keen golfer — mentioned their holiday in Scotland. Follow up in two weeks when she's back from leave."

The opportunity is updated. The personal detail is captured. The reminder is scheduled.

Between meetings, you glance at the Opportunities Dashboard. You see:
- Three deals at Proposal stage
- One at Prospect that needs attention
- Risked revenue that tells you the truth about your pipeline

*Reference: Screenshot 2 — Opportunities Dashboard (pipeline at a glance)*

### After Ten Touches

You walk into every call prepared. You open the client card and in five seconds you know:
- What stage the deal is at
- What you discussed last time
- What makes this person human

Your conversations feel continuous, not transactional. Prospects notice.

You're not doing more sales work — you're doing *smarter* sales work. The relationships stay warm because the system holds the memory you don't have space for.

### Outcome Achieved

**Without Ten Touches:** Founder-led sales = chaos, guilt, missed opportunities

**With Ten Touches:** Founder-led sales = lightweight system, consistent follow-up, deals that close

The founder didn't become a full-time salesperson. They became a *relationship-keeper* with a tool that fits their reality.

## Use Case 3: Long Sales Cycles

**The scenario:** You sell high-value services with six-to-twelve-month sales cycles. Deals require multiple stakeholders, budget approvals, and sustained engagement over time.

### Before Ten Touches

Long cycles are brutal on memory. You have a dozen deals at various stages, each with its own timeline, stakeholders, and history.

Traditional CRMs show you a pipeline view, but they don't tell you:
- When you last touched this deal
- What kind of engagement has worked
- Whether momentum is building or stalling

You end up either:
- Over-contacting (annoying the prospect)
- Under-contacting (losing momentum)

And when deals stall, you don't know why. Was it price? Timing? A competitor? A stakeholder you didn't reach?

### During Ten Touches

Each opportunity has a clear picture:
- Total value and risked revenue (so you know what's real)
- Stage progression (Prospect → Proposal → PO → Paid)
- Every touch logged with context

*Reference: Screenshot 4 — Opportunity Detail (revenue risking and stage progression)*

You schedule touches at appropriate intervals — not arbitrary "check-in" tasks, but meaningful engagements:
- A coffee to discuss their strategic priorities
- An email with relevant case studies
- A call to address the budget concern they mentioned

The reminder system tells you when to act. The Optimise dashboard tells you *how* to act.

*Reference: Screenshot 5 — Match the Moment (what works at each stage)*

### After Ten Touches

Six months in, you've maintained consistent contact without being pushy. Every touch was:
- Appropriately timed
- Contextually relevant
- Recorded for future reference

When the deal closes, you look back and see the pattern:
- 14 touches over 7 months
- Casual check-ins kept the relationship warm
- A well-timed meeting moved it from Proposal to PO

You've learned something about *how you sell* — not just *what you sold*.

### Outcome Achieved

**Without Ten Touches:** Long cycles = forgotten deals, inconsistent follow-up, lost momentum

**With Ten Touches:** Long cycles = paced engagement, honest pipeline, pattern recognition

The length of the cycle didn't change. The quality of engagement did.

## Use Case 4: Relationship Nurturing

**The scenario:** You've won the deal. The client is happy. But the real opportunity isn't over — it's just beginning. Repeat business, referrals, testimonials, and advocacy are where the long-term value lives.

### Before Ten Touches

Once a deal closes, focus shifts to delivery. The relationship enters maintenance mode — which, in practice, often means neglect.

You know you should:
- Ask for testimonials
- Request referrals
- Check in periodically
- Identify upsell opportunities

But there's no system for it. The client becomes a name in your CRM with a "Closed-Won" tag and a vague promise to "stay in touch."

Months pass. You see their LinkedIn post about a new initiative and think:

> "I should have called them last month."

### During Ten Touches

After the deal closes, you set up a relationship rhythm:
- Quarterly casual check-in (scheduled as "Casual" touch type)
- Annual review meeting
- Reminder to ask for a testimonial after successful delivery

The client card tracks quality signals:
- Testimonials given (star rating)
- Referrals made (star rating)
- Feedback provided (star rating)
- Repeat business (star rating)

*Reference: Screenshot 1 — Client Quality Scoring (4-star system)*

You glance at the card and instantly see:

> "Strong repeat business, good feedback, but no testimonials yet. Next conversation, I should ask."

### After Ten Touches

Over 18 months, the relationship deepens:
- Two follow-on projects (tracked as new opportunities)
- One warm referral (logged and followed up)
- One testimonial (finally asked, immediately given)

The client feels valued because you *show up consistently* — not just when you want something.

### Outcome Achieved

**Without Ten Touches:** Closed deals → forgotten clients → missed lifetime value

**With Ten Touches:** Closed deals → nurtured relationships → referrals, repeat business, advocacy

The sale wasn't the end. It was the start of a compounding relationship.

## Use Case 5: Daily Execution Mode

**The scenario:** It's 10am on a Tuesday. You have an hour before your next meeting. What should you do?

### Before Ten Touches

You open your task manager. There's a list of "follow-ups" — undifferentiated, unprioritised, and uninspiring.

You think:
- "I should make some calls, but I'm not in the right headspace"
- "I could send emails, but which ones are most important?"
- "Maybe I'll just check email and see what's urgent"

An hour passes. You've responded to inbound requests but made no proactive progress. The follow-up list remains untouched.

This pattern repeats daily. Reactive work crowds out relationship-building. You're busy, but not effective.

### During Ten Touches

You open the Reminders screen. The header says: **"Take Action Today."**

You see the action filter bar:
- All | SMS | Phone Call | Email | Meeting | LinkedIn | Casual

*Reference: Screenshot 3 — GTD-style action filtering*

You ask yourself: *"What do I feel like doing right now?"*

You're at your desk with 30 minutes. You tap **Email**.

The list narrows instantly. Three email follow-ups appear, each with:
- Client name
- Associated opportunity
- The reason for the follow-up (your own words)
- The due date

You knock out all three in 20 minutes.

Later, you're in the car between meetings. You tap **Phone Call**. Two calls appear. You make them both while driving.

### After Ten Touches

By 5pm, you've completed:
- 3 emails
- 2 calls
- 1 SMS
- 1 casual check-in over coffee

None of this felt like "CRM admin." It felt like *getting things done*.

The action filtering matched your work to your energy. The reminders carried context so you didn't have to reconstruct intent. The result was momentum without resistance.

### Outcome Achieved

**Without Ten Touches:** Scattered to-dos → decision fatigue → reactive work → guilt

**With Ten Touches:** Contextual actions → matched energy → proactive progress → momentum

You didn't work harder. You worked *in flow*.
