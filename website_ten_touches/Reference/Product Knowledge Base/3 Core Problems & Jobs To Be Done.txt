# Ten Touches – Core Problems & Jobs To Be Done

Jobs To Be Done & Pain Mapping

This feeds copy, ads, decks, and demos.


## 1. Primary Job

**"Help me maintain strong relationships with clients and prospects without the mental overhead of remembering every detail, managing endless follow-ups, and doing administrative work that feels like it's for someone else's benefit."**

This job statement captures the core tension: salespeople *want* to be good at relationships, but the tools they're given make relationship management feel like a burden rather than an advantage.

### Supporting Jobs

- **Help me remember who people are** — Not just names and titles, but the human details that make conversations meaningful
- **Help me follow up at the right time** — Without relying on memory or manual calendar management
- **Help me know what's working** — So I can do more of what wins and less of what doesn't
- **Help me feel like my effort is worthwhile** — Make data entry give back, not just take


## 2. Emotional Problems

These are the feelings that make CRM work feel punishing. They're often unspoken but deeply felt.

### Forgetting Personal Details

*"I know we talked about his dog, but I can't remember the name. Now I look like I wasn't listening."*

The embarrassment of forgetting something you *should* remember creates anxiety before every conversation. People avoid reaching out because they're afraid of looking careless.

**Copy-ready language:**
- "That awkward moment when you can't remember what you talked about"
- "Looking like you don't care, when you just can't remember"
- "The fear of saying 'remind me again...'"

### Guilt About Poor Follow-Up

*"I promised I'd call last week. Now it's been a month. I feel terrible."*

Missed follow-ups compound. Each day you don't reach out makes it harder to reach out. The guilt builds into avoidance, and relationships decay.

**Copy-ready language:**
- "The guilt of the unreturned call"
- "Knowing you should have followed up — three weeks ago"
- "Watching relationships slip because you got busy"

### Feeling Like CRM Work Is Wasted Effort

*"I spent twenty minutes updating Salesforce. What did I get out of it? Nothing."*

When data entry benefits the company but not the person doing it, resentment builds. The CRM becomes the enemy of productivity, not a tool for it.

**Copy-ready language:**
- "Data entry that helps your boss but not you"
- "CRM as punishment, not tool"
- "Logging activity for someone else's dashboard"

### Dread of Admin Time

*"End of day means CRM catch-up. I hate it."*

The anticipation of admin work creates a negative association with the whole sales process. People delay, batch, and eventually skip.

**Copy-ready language:**
- "The Sunday night dread of Monday's data entry"
- "That sinking feeling when you see your empty CRM"
- "Admin time that steals from selling time"

### Imposter Syndrome About Organisation

*"Everyone else seems to have their contacts organised. I'm just winging it."*

Disorganised salespeople often feel alone in their chaos. They assume others have cracked the code, when in reality most people struggle with the same problems.

**Copy-ready language:**
- "Feeling like you're the only one who can't keep track"
- "Pretending you have a system when you don't"
- "The secret shame of the disorganised salesperson"


## 3. Functional Problems

These are the practical, day-to-day friction points that slow people down.

### Searching for People by Memory Fragments

*"I met her at the conference. She had a French bulldog. She worked in... fintech? What was her name?"*

Traditional CRMs require precise search terms. Ten Touches lets you search by what you actually remember: pets, sports teams, interests, any detail you captured.

**Copy-ready language:**
- "Remembering the dog but not the name"
- "Searching by what you actually remember"
- "Finding people the way your brain works"

### Recalling Meetings After the Fact

*"I know we talked about pricing concerns. But was that this client or another one?"*

Without immediate capture, meeting details blend together. Important objections, commitments, and next steps get lost or confused.

**Copy-ready language:**
- "That meeting from last week — what did we actually discuss?"
- "When all your calls blur into one"
- "The details you wish you'd written down"

### Manual Data Entry Burden

*"Every field is another click. Every record is another five minutes."*

Form-based data entry is slow, tedious, and happens at the wrong time (hours after the conversation). Voice input removes the friction and captures details while they're fresh.

**Copy-ready language:**
- "Twenty fields, zero motivation"
- "The form that never ends"
- "Typing on your phone when you should be driving"

### Inconsistent Follow-Ups

*"Some clients I follow up with religiously. Others fall through the cracks."*

Without a system, follow-up quality varies by memory, preference, and recency. Important relationships get neglected while squeaky wheels get attention.

**Copy-ready language:**
- "The clients you remember vs the clients you forget"
- "Following up when you remember — which isn't often enough"
- "Inconsistency that costs deals"

### No Visibility Into What Works

*"I make calls. I send emails. I have no idea which ones actually help me win."*

Most salespeople operate on instinct, habit, or manager instruction. They don't have personal data on which actions lead to their wins.

**Copy-ready language:**
- "Selling blind"
- "Doing what you're told vs doing what works for you"
- "No feedback loop on your own behaviour"


## 4. Behavioural Problems

These are patterns of behaviour that emerge from bad tools and misaligned incentives.

### Low CRM Adoption

*"I update it when I have to. Which is almost never."*

When CRMs don't deliver value to the user, usage drops. Data becomes stale. Management loses visibility. Everyone loses.

**Why this happens:**
- No immediate payoff for the user
- Time cost exceeds perceived benefit
- System feels like surveillance, not support

### Incomplete Data

*"I've got name and email. That's about it."*

Minimal effort produces minimal data. Client records become placeholder stubs rather than useful relationship memory.

**Why this happens:**
- Too many fields, too little time
- Personal details feel "optional"
- No obvious benefit to completeness

### Reactive Rather Than Proactive Selling

*"I respond when clients reach out. I don't initiate much."*

Without reminders and momentum tracking, salespeople default to reactive mode. They wait for opportunities instead of creating them.

**Why this happens:**
- No system prompting outreach
- Follow-up requires active memory
- Proactive selling feels like more admin


## 5. Current Workarounds

Before Ten Touches, people cobble together imperfect solutions. Understanding these validates the problem.

### Notes Apps

**What people do:** Keep contact notes in Apple Notes, Notion, Evernote, or Google Docs.

**Why it fails:**
- Not structured or searchable
- No reminders or follow-up prompts
- Disconnected from calendar and email
- Easy to forget which note has what

### Memory Alone

**What people do:** Try to remember everything — names, details, promises, next steps.

**Why it fails:**
- Human memory is unreliable at scale
- Stress increases forgetting
- Confidence drops when memory fails
- No backup when you forget

### Spreadsheets

**What people do:** Build custom contact trackers in Excel or Google Sheets.

**Why it fails:**
- Manual maintenance
- No mobile-friendly input
- No reminders
- Quickly becomes outdated

### Inbox Searches

**What people do:** Search email to reconstruct relationship history.

**Why it fails:**
- Only captures email interactions
- Misses calls, meetings, and informal contact
- Time-consuming to piece together
- No personal details captured

### Calendar Reminders

**What people do:** Set calendar events for follow-ups.

**Why it fails:**
- No context on *why* you're following up
- Clutters calendar with tasks
- Easy to dismiss and forget
- No connection to relationship history


## 6. Why Existing Solutions Fail

Traditional CRMs fail because they ignore how humans actually work.

### Time Delay Between Action and Entry

**The problem:** You have a great conversation. You mean to log it. Three days pass. Now you can barely remember what you discussed.

**Why it matters:** Data quality depends on capture speed. The longer the delay, the less accurate and useful the record.

**Ten Touches solution:** Voice input immediately after conversations, when insight is freshest.

### Cognitive Load of Data Entry

**The problem:** Every field is a decision. Every form is friction. By the time you've filled out a contact record, you've used mental energy that could have gone to selling.

**Why it matters:** Willpower is finite. If data entry feels hard, it won't happen.

**Ten Touches solution:** Voice-first capture that structures data automatically. Speak naturally; the system does the rest.

### Lack of Immediate Payoff

**The problem:** You enter data. Nothing happens. The data sits there for a manager to review, but you get nothing back.

**Why it matters:** Humans respond to incentives. If the tool doesn't help you, you won't use it.

**Ten Touches solution:** Insights that show you what's working, reminders that keep you on track, and relationship memory that makes every conversation better.

### Desktop-First Design

**The problem:** Most CRMs assume you're at a desk with a full keyboard. Real salespeople are in cars, at events, between meetings, on their phones.

**Why it matters:** If the tool isn't available when you need it, it's useless.

**Ten Touches solution:** Mobile-first design with voice input that works wherever you are.

### Built for Reporting, Not Relationships

**The problem:** CRMs are designed to give managers visibility into pipelines and activity. They're not designed to help salespeople remember people or follow up better.

**Why it matters:** When the tool serves the wrong master, the right users stop using it.

**Ten Touches solution:** Every feature is designed to help the individual seller first. Management visibility emerges from user value, not from compliance demands.
